# Homework2_SR
This is the file repository for Homework #2 due on 11/14/20.

This repository contains the code for a website I developed that has multiple different html pages. The first page is an About Me page, the second page allows a user to enter in contact information, and the third page is a portfolio of images of me and things that are important to me.

There are three html pages: "index.html", "contact.html", and "portfolio.html". All three pages link to a CSS style sheet labeled "style.css". Additionally, the html pages are linked to Bootstrap and incorporate Bootstrap elements.

The page is responsive such that when you resize the page, it reformats for ease of viewing on mobile, tablet, or desktop screens.

Here are screenshots of the live pages:
