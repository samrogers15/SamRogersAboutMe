                    <p>Hello! My name is Sam Rogers and I am an entry-level, full stack developer currently taking classes to learn programming languages and discover which language speaks to me the most. I was born in New Jersey and received my B.A. in Economcs at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C. After graduating from college, I moved to New York City and spent eight years living in various neighborhoods of Manhattan, mostly in the East Village. In 2017, I moved to Portland, OR in order to change my lifestyle and gain easier access to the thing that I love the most - playing outside! Whether it be hiking, camping, skiing, rock-climbing, mountaineering, or swimming...you name it, I like to do it! Professionally, I've spent the past 12 years working at various advertising agencies with a concentration in media, marketing, and communications. If you get a chance, check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuelerogers/" target="_blank">LinkedIn Profile</a> to see some of the companies I've worked at. I really like working with Microsoft Excel and architecting complex spreadsheets that maximize the automation of numbers. I figured that programming and coding would be very similar, and that the problem-solving and critical-thinking aspects of the work that I like would translate well - so far, that seems to be the case! It's like a big puzzle that needs to be solved with logic, instead of numbers (if I were to dumb it down).</p>
                    
                    <p>What else can I tell you? Right now, I live with my partner Lara and our 6 month old Silver Lab Lola in a house near the Hollywood district. Lara and I have many things in common and enjoy vegging on the couch just as much as we enjoy outdoor activities. Lola has been a handful these past 6 months - but she brings us such a world of joy. It's been exciting to train her to be a good pup, but tiring as well. Rest assured, we're both becoming experts at cleaning the floor! Lara is also from back east (she grew up outside of Pittsburgh) and she's an RN - quite the honorable career choice. Anyone would be extremely well cared for on Lara's watch - she's an amazing person and I'm proud of her. She's also a great cook (we both love cooking) and an amazing baker. Just the other day, she made a cranberry pumpkin bread that somehow also turned out to be healthy. Finally, I have two brothers who I have an incredibly close relationship with and whom I talk to on a regular basis. They live on the east coast so I haven't seen them in quite some time - boy do I miss them! Well, that's it for me right now. Catch you soon!</p>
